## People of Nortia Disappear Without a Trace

Nortia, a small province at the northwestern edge of the Kingdom, continues to experience hardship. First unusual weather patterns have forced the area into perpetual overcast for months, which is starting to impact crop yields. Trade caravans and travelers have gone missing. And now this week, there are reports of an entire town of people suddenly going missing. Mister White and his son took a shipment of goods to the next town down the road, stayed the night, and when they returned, they found the entire village had vanished. There were no signs of struggle nor any damage to buildings observed. “It’s like they all just decided to walk away,” said a confused Mister White.

## Alvis Announces International Tour

Beloved entertainer Alvis Parsley has announced another world tour. The King of Bards now heads to the East where he will play at several venues across all 7 major countries. Most of the time will be spent in the Carmel Kingdom and Hershey Empire. “I had to cut my last tour short for personal reasons,” Alvis said in an interview. “Now that things are a little more settled, it’s time to get back to doing what I do best: bringing hope and joy to the people of the world.”

## Art Heist of the Century

In Xanthium, the Phantom Thieves have struck again. This time they targeted the Rikplatz Museum which earlier this week debuted seven new Donatello paintings. When museum staff arrived this morning, they found all seven paintings missing and the word “STOLEN” was painted on the now empty wall space. The customary calling card was also found, which denounced Donatello as a plagiarist who claimed his apprentices’ artwork as his own. Donatello asserts that the accusation is false and that the thieves are trying to discredit his good name. Xanthium investigators are baffled, and even the Lemurian Guild seems to have made little headway in apprehending the Phantom Thieves.
