## Background

Magic Brian (deceased) was a former guild member and renown necromancer that went missing on a solo mission for the Guild. He endeavored to change stigma associated with necromancy by using his specialty for the good of the Kingdom. 

In the library, there is an entire shelf devoted to his journals with his first-hand accounts on the Great Orc War. He also penned the ‘Treatise on the Social Benefits of Necromancy’. His writing was known to be verbose, in contrast to his speech. 

After he went missing, his Staff propped up in the Goodwitch's catacomb, ceaselessly reanimating the dead. Once the guild members fought a monster to retrieve the staff and ended the undead reanimation. 
> Magic Brian's Staff's last wielder is Gaille.

## Battle of Heraculon

In the Battle of Heraculon, Magic Brian -- or a very close likeness to him -- leading the opposing forces. 'Magic Brian' summoned a colossal monstrosity of bone and undead flesh in addition to another dinosaur creature. 

The Battle of Heraculon was a guild initiated, 3 wave attack on an underground labyrinth teeming with undead. The assault was a pyrrhic victory: many guild members and veterans, like Runt, died in the attack. After the battle all of the undead in the underground network disappeared without a trace.

## Fun Fact
- Magic Brian was a PC from a previous campaign the DMs were a part of and inspired by the character Magic Brian from ‘Adventure Zone’.
