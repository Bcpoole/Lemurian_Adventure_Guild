# Writ Scribbler

Writ has strong ideals of truth and justice.
She has a penchant for getting information from unexpected sources, has ties to both the upper echelons and lowest dregs of society, and does not particularly like that the Guild wields so much power.
She sees herself as an intrepid journalist willing to write about the things most people wouldn't (though she does the occasional puff piece to keep her readership up).
