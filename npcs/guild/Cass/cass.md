# Cass
Occupation: Surgeon

Cass is the Guild's surgeon. They are an alcoholic and have a very tragic backstory.

They are a changling and go by both he/him and she/her pronouns. 

## Fun Fact

- Cass is a rogue
- Jonathan could not decide whether Cass was a boy or girl so Cass appeared in the Guild with both he/him and she/her pronouns. Tina suggested Cass be a Changling to canonically justify Cass' shifting genders.
