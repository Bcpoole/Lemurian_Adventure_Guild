Vice Commander

Former Head of Internal Security

This half-orc made a name for himself by backing the raid on Marcus Goodwitch's estate and proving the man's complicity in one of the Syndicate's schemes.
He was rewarded with a promotion to Vice Commander.
Gideon is an ardent supporter of the Kingdom of Lemuria and pushes the Guild to work hard to ensure her prosperity.
