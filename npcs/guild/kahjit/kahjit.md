Purveyor of Fine Goods

He [has wares if you have coin](https://youtu.be/LQvsA8uduGA?t=1).

Kahjit and Khajit are often mistaken for being the same cat. They are not. They are twin brothers.

## Kitjit

Kitjit is a young nephew of Khajit. They are very excitable and will ruthlessly fleece you of all your money.
