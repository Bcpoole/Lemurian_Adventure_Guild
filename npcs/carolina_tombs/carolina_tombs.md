## Background

Carolina Tomes, archeologist extraordinaire and occasional lecturer at the Institute of Magic, was researching the relics and history related to the Holy Caramel Empire. She has occasionally called upon the Guild to help clear traps in archeological locations with strong traps. She is currently missing. IN her last confirmed sighting she was being held against her will by the Syndicate. 

## Previous Missions

### Aquatic Artifact Acquisition

CR: 8

Background: A research team has discovered the location of an aquatic temple at the bottom of a lake. Judging by the decorations, they believe it to be connected to the Holy Carmel Empire. Normally this is the kind of thing they would consult Carolina Tomes for, but since she is still missing, they tried hiring out another team of specialists. They managed to make it through several rooms of the temple, but then went through a door and did not reemerge. The research team is willing to pay the Guild for their help.
Objective: Explore the final few rooms, disarm any traps or defenses within, and secure any valuable artifacts.

Outcome: The team from the Guild found the research team dead and their camp destroyed. Upon entering swimming to the bottom of the lake they found the aquatic temple and entered. Within the temple there were 3 puzzle chambers separated by stairs. Surprisingly each of the puzzles were solved and the teams progressed to the fourth room. Here they saw a Syndicate team being led by a mysterious man in black and red robes. The Syndicate was forcing Carolina Tombs to open a large 10 ft cylinder in the middle of the fourth room. Before they could defeat the Syndicate team or rescue Carolina the team was pulled back by the portal. This was not originally a mission that involved Carolina Tombs, but it was the last reported sighting of her. 

### Raiders of the Lost Tomb

CR: 6

Background: Carolina Tomes, archeologist extraordinaire, has just discovered this tomb from the Holy Carmel Empire. She believes it to be the resting place of one of the Emperors! She wants you to move through and clear all the traps in the path so she can safely remove any artifacts she finds and take her time examining the ruins. This mission may require multiple attempts to clear out all of the traps.

Outcome: Various team members from the Guild were able to disarm the traps in the tomb. Upon clearing the last puzzle, Carolina came into possession of a staff that once belonged to the Holy Caramel Emperor. After the last team portaled back the Guild could not reach Carolina to confirm completion of the mission. Upon further investigation the Guild learned that the real Carolina had gone missing 2 weeks prior and have not heard or seen Carolina since.
### Carolina Tomes and the Hidden Temple

CR: 5

Background: Carolina Tomes has deciphered some ancient maps and murals and is certain there is a temple of the Holy Carmel Empire hidden up a cavern river running under the mountains. She needs some help with getting there and exploring whatâ€™s inside.

Objective: Help Carolina investigate the temple. This will likely take several runs to fully explore, so take good notes. Make sure you return Carolina to the base camp safely before you are pulled back to the Guild.

Outcome: The teams from the Guild cleared all of the traps in the Temple and found a large chamber with a statue for some deity. The team was able to recover a necklace of fireballs, which Carolina archived along with the other research.
