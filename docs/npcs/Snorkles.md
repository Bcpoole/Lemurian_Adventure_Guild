# Snorkles

## Background
Snorkles is a monkey faced menace upon society.
It can occasionally be seen shoving creatures into a seemingly bottomless bag of holding.
Whenever Snorkles is found either in the guildhall or on a guild member's mission, it will pull out creatures from its bag.

The Guild provides hazard pay to guild members who minimize the damage of "Snorkles Events".

## Snorkles Events

> :warning: **WARNING**: Snorkles is exceedingly dangerous. Approach the monkey at your own risk.
There are 2 types of Snorkles events:

1. **A Bag Episode**    
Snorkles will place a bag of holding on the ground and throw out 3 "rounds" of monsters from his bag of holding. 
Guild members are paid to slay these monsters. 
2. **Snorkles goes on an Adventure!**   
Snorkles joins the adventuring party on a regularly scheduled mission. 
Guild members must babysit Snorkles while he actively makes their lives harder.

> _House Rule_: Any monster parts looted from Snorkles' monsters can only be used for cosmetic upgrades
