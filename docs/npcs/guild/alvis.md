The King of Rock

Proprietor of the Guild Tavern

Former member of the Lemurian Guild

This halfling traveled the world through the Guild's portal, then broke off to start his own career as the greatest bard in history.
His traveling shows draw huge crowds.
He is still known to take on the occasional mission on the Guild's behalf and he has an uncanny ability to show up in the right place at the right time.
