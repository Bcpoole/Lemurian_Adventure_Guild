*Yuna*

Three young ladies who ran the Guild Tavern.
When they were younger, each was saved by Alvis and sent to work within the Guild Hall as a safety measure.
They have since been kidnapped by the Syndicate.

The guild has been searching for clues on where they are being held.
They uncovered a ritual where Yuna was being held in the center.
The whole guild mobilized to disrupt the ritual.
As the ritual was about to come to fruition, Feirfiz slew Yuna, preventing her from being transformed into The Black Dragon.
