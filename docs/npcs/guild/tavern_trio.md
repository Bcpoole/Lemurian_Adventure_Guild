Three young ladies who ran the Guild Tavern.
When they were younger, each was saved by Alvis and sent to work within the Guild Hall as a safety measure.
They have since been kidnapped by the Syndicate.

The guild has been searching for clues on where they are being held.
They uncovered a ritual where Yuna was being held in the center.
The whole guild mobilized to disrupt the ritual.
As the ritual was about to come to fruition, [Feirfiz](../../player_characters/Feirfiz) slew Yuna, preventing her from being transformed into The Black Dragon.
