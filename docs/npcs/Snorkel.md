# Snorkel

Snorkel is a monkey faced menace upon society. It can occassionally be seen shoving creatures into a seemingly bottomless bag of holding. Whenever Snorkel is found either in the guildhall or on a guildmember's mission, it will pull out creatures from its bag. 

The Guild provides hazard pay to guildmembers who minimize the damage of "Snorkel Events"
