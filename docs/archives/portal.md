# Portal

A mysterious portal used as the cornerstone of the Lemurian Guild.

The portal can transport any living creatures that pass through it anywhere in the world. Those creatures will remain there for a brief period of time before being drawn back to the portal entrance. The Guild uses this to send small squads of members wherever they need to be to accomplish a given mission.

Portal time moves strangely. [Players will have until 8:45 real world time on game days before the portal return activates. The portal will pull players back at that time, no matter how close they are to mission completion. Players should monitor the clock and act accordingly.]

Passing through the portal normally does not have any other effects on creatures. Exceptions occurred for a brief period while Wendy was injured and unconscious. Strange minor effects were noted such as tasting colors, ending up in the wrong locations, or portal time shortening or extending. While Wendy was injured, the Syndicate managed to hijack the portal and use it to allow their agents into the Guild Hall. Wendy was awakened and did something to repair the portal to its normal state.

The [Invictus Syndicate](./syndicate) appears to use their own portal magic to move their agents around the world. It is unknown how the Syndicate portal system is similar or different to the Lemurian Guild's.
