# Invictus Syndicate

![syndicate](/img/syndicate.png)

The Invictus Syndicate is a mysterious group operating in the shadows of Lemuria. The Syndicate's aims are destructive, and they have no qualms about hurting innocents to get what they want. It is therefore a main duty of the Lemurian Guild to fight back against the Syndicate's goals. They appear to use a portal magic similar to the Guild's portal to move agents around the world. The details of their portal and differences to the guild's portal are currently unknown.

The Syndicate uses a branch and cell structure which makes rooting out the entire organization difficult, if not impossible. Often agents in a cell will have very few details about what they are doing, why they are doing it, or even the identity of their immediate superior. Branches seem to work independently of one another and have at times even seemed at odds with one another. Still Syndicate agents, especially those in leadership positions, are extremely powerful and are not to be taken lightly.
