## Background
Bart, short for Bartholemew, is a half-orc fighter who's convinced he's a wizard.
He has studied long and hard in the ancient art of "Stick Magic".
Stick Magic is a highly complex and difficult school of magic that uses sticks, sticks with points, and sticks with rocks as foci to apply blunt force trauma to a spell's victims.
In other words, he hits or throws things very hard and fast.

Bart is known for using a sickly looking quarterstaff he carved out of Plague Tree wood he obtained from his first guild mission.
He has become very proficient in throwing weapons.

His best friend is Leal'tad.
