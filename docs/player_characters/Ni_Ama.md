# Ni Ama

Eladrin Circle of Stars Druid

![Ni Ama](/img/players/Ni_Ama.png)

A Spring Eladrin Druid from the Feywilds, she came over a short while after the Guild sent some members on an extended mission.
Little did they know that after their departure, the Court was abuzz with talk, tales, and fanfiction of the brave group.
Ni Ama, being a consummate explorer and plant cultivator/Wilds protector, used the possibility of exploring a new plane as a fantastic excuse to come through the portal and join the Guild.
Reality being she just wanted to meet all the hero's she had heard so many tales about.

Spring Eladrins are the embodiment of new life, energy, and regrowth.
Flowers tend to bloom, and plants will sprout in her presence when excited or happy.
