# Lucy Zala

Half-Elf Rogue

Infiltrator and On-and-Off Tavern Cook

Lucy grew up on the streets of Lemuria as an orphan, never knowing her parents. She would have died early on if not for the help of an older urchin, a dwarf named Kit Zala. Kit taught her how to scavenge and gather food, which kept the both of them from starving and getting sick. Lucy has joined the Lemurian guild in the wake of Kit's death.
