# Gaille

Elf Necromancer Wizard.

Inheritor of Magic Brian's Staff, resident corpse interrogator, plant talker, and supplier of discounted health potions.

Gaille is a young elf who ran off before her naming ceremony to obtain more knowledge of world. She is a firm believer that those who do not know their history cannot learn from it and thus are doomed to repeat it. As such, uncovering lost knowledge and preserving it for future generations is one of her interests. Her delving into necromancy may have something to do with this pursuit of knowledge.
