![Bavazi](/img/players/Bavazi.png)

Bavazi was thrown out from his temple of Irori when he lost his temper defending a local villager and killed the assailant. He now hopes to continue his service to Irori by protecting the weak and hopes that one day he can find a way to channel his temper to do good.
