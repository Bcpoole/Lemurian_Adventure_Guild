Spawned from average parents (*4 +0 , 2 +1, 1 -1 stat roll*) into a standard familial unit, Tar'kiz's (*Standard Array*) parental units spent their spare income on books to educate their son.
Tar'kiz graducated from 5 prestigious universities in artificing with straight **E**'s for **E**xcellence. *(He was **E**xpelled from 5 universities for producing hazards).*
Hearing of the Lemurian Adventure Guild's Fey Portal, he infiltrated the Guild *(went on a mission after only sitting around in the Library)* where he studies the portal to learn how to weaponize it.

His archnemesis is Trithagerous due to his annoying nature.

Tar'kiz powers his artificer cannon within a MÃ¶bius Cube battery powered by a demon he sealed away summoned by [Ravinust](./Ravinust) by accident in the library.
