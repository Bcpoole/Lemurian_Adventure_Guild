# Numrikar

Human wizard

A scruffy and shifty looking string bean of a man. He is a “Magician of the Change,” in his words. Most take him to mean transmutation, though you will never hear him say that. He has somewhat ragged looking peasant clothes, his worn, leather bound spell book full of dog-ears and bookmarks, and dagger with a simple blade, but a handle that looks like it was once ceremonial and significant that has been worn down with time.

Numrik only calls the man who taught him magic “The Master.” After studying under him for most of his life and coming to an understanding magic at a basic level, he was sent out to the world. He joined the guild to earn some cash and learn as much as he can about magic before setting off to find his master’s secrets.
