# Trithagerous Maximus

Goblin Zealot Barbarian

Player: Brandon

## Backstory

Earning his adult name due the size of his muscles on a below-average height goblin awakard physique, Trithagerous looks like an upsidedown green triangle.

Trithagerous hails from a neighboring kingdom.
His entire tribe was wiped out by a group of adventurers hired by a greedy baron wanting their lands.
The last standing and most dangerous of the adventurers was a fireball slinging wizard.
Trithagerous, not by an particular merit of his own but by merely being out-of-place, avoided the last fireball and got the finishing blow on the wizard.
He wears scraps of that wizard's robe in rememberance of his tribe. Hearing of a land of more acceptance for his kind, he set off for Lemuria to improve his skills so that he protect the weak from villians who use fireballs.
