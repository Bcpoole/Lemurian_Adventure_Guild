# Player Characters

The Lemurian Adventure Guild is full of many colorful faces from all walks of life.

Players can have up to two active characters in a Long Rest cycle. This includes for RPing on Discord. If you want to play a third character, you can, but you will not be able to play them in the current Long Rest cycle. You can switch out characters between Long Rest cycles.
