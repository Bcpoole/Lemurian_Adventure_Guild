# Isair and Madea

![Isair](/img/players/isair.webp) Isair

[Isair](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Isair) and [Madae](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Madae) are the half-fiend twins of the devil [Belhifet](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Belhifet) and the elven priestess of [Ilmater](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ilmater), [Ilmadia Bariel](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ilmadia_Bariel). Isair and Madae were born in the year 1282 DR.

Ilmadia's first death was at the hands of adventurers in the year 1281 DR who were seeking to thwart the plans of the devil Belhifet, whom Ilmadia only knew as Revered Brother Poquelin.

In 1282 DR, another priestess of Ilmater, Egenia, resurrected Ilmadia. The two were surprised when it was found her womb teemed with life. After her children were born with the aid of the druid Iselore. Tragically, Ilmadia cast herself from a cliff at the sight of her children's deformities. Her son with his twisted legs and cloven hooves and her daughter with her tail. Both with their wings and horns. Iselore named the twins for his parents, the boy was named Isair and the girl Madae.

Egenia raised the twins on the outskirts of the village of Kuldahar. Isair was raised as a fighter and a sorcerer while Madae was groomed to be a priestess of Ilmater. Egenia's death is when the townsfolk of Kuldahar came upon the twins, as they performed burial rites for the woman who had raised them. The townsfolk drove them from Kuldahar and the two moved on to Luskan where they survived by intimidation and games of chance.

Eventually, the twins made contact with Luskan's Arcane Brotherhood to be emissaries to the Abyssal plane where they could try their hand at the Blood War. However, they were no more accepted by the denizens of the lower planes than they were by the inhabitants of the Prime Material Plane.

It was sometime between Egenia's death and their journey to the Abyssal Plane that Madae abandoned Ilmater in favor of Iyachtu Xvim, the bastard son of Bane. Disgusted at their treatment, Isair and Madae returned to the Spine of the World and took over the elven ruin, the Severed Hand. They sought to found a nation where outcasts such as themselves would be accepted. During this founding, they sent emissaries to other regions to set up trade. Every region turned their emissaries away save for Bryn Shander of the Ten Towns. However, this was a ploy. The mayor of Bryn Shander, with the aid of a cleric, divined the twins' infernal heritage and sent his own emissary with gifts of food and drink. All laced with holy water. Enraged by the insult and injured by the tainted food, Isair and Madae imprisoned Bryn Shander's emissary and sent their army, the Legion of the Chimera, out to war.

Isair and Madae were defeated in the year 1312 DR by a band of adventurers in service to the town of Targos and the twins, along with their fortress, were sent to the Plane of Limbo.

For nearly 75 years, Isair and Madae languished on the chaotic plane until it was destroyed when the Spellplague rocked the planes in 1385 DR.

This where the twins' stories separate. Isair felt a peculiar sensation after Limbo was destroyed. Weight. His body had weight again. He opened his eyes to see he was again on the Prime Material Plane. He laughed at his good fortune, but his mirth was short-lived when he realized that Madae was not beside him.

Over the next century, Isair learned what had transpired in his absence and he learned the various ways he had been changed by his time in Limbo. His strength had diminished significantly, he did not feel the infernal taint of his father as strongly as he once did even as the Art still burned through his blood the same.

Isair provided for himself by moving from mercenary company to mercenary company. Never staying too long as he was searching for whispers, rumors of other demonkin, hoping one would lead him to his sister. However, Isair also found himself distrustful of the "pureblood races", as he terms them due to the experiences he suffered in his time before Limbo. His "previous life".

In recent years, however, he became a close friend of a tabaxi rogue who he nicknamed "Ninja" due to her preferred play of sneaking up behind him to startle him. With this friendship, he was able to overcome his distrust. In return, Flibble got quite the intimidating big brother.

Isair and Flibble eventually found themselves in Lemuria where they joined the guild. He was pleasantly surprised that, contrary to what he was expecting, he was accepted even with his demon blood as readily as Flibble was accepted without it. Isair still tends to be more comfortable around other demonkin. Flibble assures everyone that she's working on it.

Much like Isair after Limbo was destroyed, she appeared once again on the Prime Material Plane and was at first ecstatic and then heartbroken to see her brother was not there. She happened across an elder cleric of Kelemvor named Entar as she got her bearings. She traveled with this man for a time and he filled her in on the history she had missed. Madae was impressed by the actions of the mortals Midnight, Cyric, and Kelemvor during the Time of Troubles that had elevated them to godhood and horrified when she heard of the Bhaalspawn Crisis a couple decades later. Entar also spent this time grooming Madae to serve Kelemvor as he did. In this way, Madae and Entar spent their time moving from place to place offering their services as clerics in exchange for rumors of demonkin, food, drink, and lodging.

Eventually, age caught up with Entar and Madae was left without traveling companions for many years until one day rumor reached Madae of a winged demonkin in Lemuria but nothing more specific. She immediately set out to find her way there. Upon arriving, Madae unknowingly happened upon an agent of the Syndicate. Without revealing her identity or the group she worked for, this agent promised to look into these rumors of winged demonkin in exchange for small services. Madae, not knowing the history of the place, agreed. She was then instructed about the dead drop system and that if this agent learned anything about the rumors, those tidbits would be put in the dead drops as well.

It was a lie, though. A manipulation to string Madae along. There would be enough false tidbits frequently enough that she did not catch on.

Eventually, Madae's dead drop told her to investigate a mass of elementals being led by an elf on its way to the capitol city. It was there while she was helping the wounded that she and her brother were finally reunited.
