## Backstory

Lost.

It happened so long ago. An escape. A storm. A ship torn apart. His brothers cast into the sea. Had he done enough? Could he have saved them?

His travels sent him through so many lands, collecting trinkets and stories along the way. He would sail to any shore...except home. How could he? How could he face the truth, if it was what he feared? Either shame, or something worse.

Eventually he arrived in Faundell, needing a place to rest his shell. A family of wood elves took him in, welcoming him as one of his own, reminding him what he had once had. When the eldest headed off in search of opportunity and adventure, Raffolo followed after. Could he redeem himself of the failure he carried like an anchor around his neck? Could he earn back what he had lost?
