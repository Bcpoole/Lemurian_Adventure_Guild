# HP at Each Level

At first level, your character's HP is the maximum roll on your Hit Die + DON modifier as normal.
At every subsequent level, roll your new level's hit die.
You may then choose to take the result of your roll or choose to instead use the average of the roll rounded down.
In either case, add your CON modifier as normal.

:::tip Example

## Conan the Barbarian

1. Rolls 1d12 and gets a 9.
2. Keeps this roll and adds his CON modifier of +3 for a total of +12HP.
3. This health is added to both his current and total HP.

## Squish the Wizard

1. Rolls 1d6 and gets a 2.
2. Chooses to take the average rounded down of 3 instead, then adds his CON modifier of +0 to gain a total of +3HP.
