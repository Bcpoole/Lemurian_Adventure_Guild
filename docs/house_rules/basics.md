# Basics

## DM Fiat

DMs reserve the right to adjust any rules at any time for the sake of fairness, balance, or fun.

## Portal

The portal is mysterious, but operates on its own mostly consistent set of rules. The portal opens at 7pm and closes promptly at 8:45pm real world time on game days. Portal usage out of game (i.e. via discord) will have a posted limit on when the portal will close.

## Rest Schedule

In between every session is a rest, with everybody on the same schedule. The pattern is session -> short rest -> session -> short rest -> session -> long rest.

:::tip Character too burnt out?
Consider creating an alt character if playing all 3 sessions a long rest cycle.

## Levels

No experience is awarded in the game. Instead, experience is represented by paying gold which represents how you buy training time with experts in the guild. [Experience Point table](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/step-by-step-characters#XPandProficiencyBonusProgression).

:::important Experience is Accumulative
Level 2 requires 300 xp and level 3 requires 900 xp, so the cost from 2->3 is 600 xp.
