### Trithagerous

> *Trithagerous hobbles to the front, teary eyed* "Several of us today probably wouldn't be standing here today if not for Mistoffelees. We were surrounded by an overpowering force of hobgoblins, pinned down in a trench. Mistoffelees bravely held her own protecting our rear to prevent us from getting overwhelmed after Fenris was struck down. You have our eternal thanks. See you later, Fire Druid." *He lights a candle at that altar.*
