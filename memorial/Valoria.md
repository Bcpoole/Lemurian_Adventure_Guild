## Memorial

The Guild gathers to pay respects to the fallen. Cecilia speaks first. "We honor the memories of Lucy and Valoria. Lucy has been with us for some time and has served the Guild and Lemuria faithfully. Valoria is relatively new to us, but she has made a lasting impact in her time here. Both met their end fighting to protect our fair nation, and neither will be forgotten. Would anyone like to share a few words?"

### Fenris

_He turns to regard Valoria’s memorial display next._

“I did not know what to think of Valoria when she first arrived. She was so proud and skeptical and no nonsense. She definitely put us through the wringer! I remember when I was supposed to be the lookout on a secret mission, and it turned out Valoria had caught wind of it and stealthily trailed us the whole time — I was mortified! But she cared about Ulgrim and I think she grew to care about us, too. She gifted me a set of magical arrows before our Feywild trip and I never got to thank her for her kindness. So, thank you, Valoria. Safe travels to those distant shores.”
