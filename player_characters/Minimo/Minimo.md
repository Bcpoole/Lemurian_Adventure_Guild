He'd go from town to town helping sort their libraries and made them more accessible to the local populace. It is easy to forget the stories of heros if their stories are not written down. He came to the Lemurian Guild in order to help them write dossiers and clean up the Archives.

Minimo will have kleptomaniac episodes whenever he is frightened or threatened. He does not remember anything from the episodes.

Despite being scared of everything, Minimo calms down when he hears music. Enemies fear the lullaby sung from his lips when he enters murder mouse mode.

## In the Guild

Minimo's first mission was to apprehend the Phantom Thieves. His kleptomania flared up and caused him to instinctually grab a broken [Bead of Fog] that creates perpetual fog whenever it is touched. His theft was found out when he tried to cast [identify] on the bead in the Garden. Guildmembers were unable to swipe the bead away from Minimo until Sir Giblet appeared and knocked the Mousekin out. Minimo was fined for this theft.

Minimo does not have a strong grasp of his finances because he buries all of his gold and treasures in the Garden. 

### Job Application
Sir Giblet urged Minimo to put in a job application for Kahjit's job listing. Unfortunately, nepotism won out and Taxbreak got the job over him.


## Kangeroo Mousekin Lore

Kangeroo Mousekin are reculsive, jumpy critters. Most of the time, they look exactly like a kangeroo rat but are significantly more intelligent. A few of them are comparatively giant. Tallmice as they are called, grow to be between 1.5-2.5 ft tall. Unlike their smaller counterparts, they CAN speak common. Tallice are often representatives for the smallfolk. They may be active guardians of smallfolk burrows or may travel between towns gathering winter supplies, but the vast majority of them are ambassadors. They try to create legal protections or carve out places for the small to live besides the tallfolk. This has rarely worked but they continue to hope it may someday.

Smallguard is a highly prestigous job that many smallfolk children aspire to be when they grow up. The smallguards protect hidden mousefolk villages from monsters but also regular predators like cats, raccoons, and owls. They are fearless. There is a childhood story of a 5 mouse team destroying a single eagle's nest. They worked together to craft rope, scaled a giant oak, and fought the eagle as if it was a dragon all in order to destroy the predator's nest. Smallguard keep the smallfolk safe from the many monsters that would see them as prey.

The greatest of smallguards are knighted and become retainers to the tallguards. As retainers, they act as accountants, watch mice, and the assistant for the tallmouse's ambassador needs.
