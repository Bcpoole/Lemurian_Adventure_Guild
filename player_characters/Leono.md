# Leono

Tortle Paladin (Redemption)

Style: Support and damage-reduction frontline tank

## Backstory

Leono lost his father in an accident and his brothers shortly after in a shipwreck that left him orphaned and alone back on his home shores. He was taken in by the local Church of Om, raised as their ward and steeped in their beliefs.

Years later, he received a letter from the Guild, on behalf of his long-lost but now truly deceased brother Raffolo. He had been taught his whole life that forgiveness was the greatest virtue, but how could he forgive the unforgivable? He set off immediately for the Guild to try to live up to his values...even a fool's errand like redeeming the memory of his wicked brother.
