# Spifanon

Satyr Great Old One Warlock

Spifanon worked for many years tending the grove of the Elder Stag. It was there he first met his wife and there he trained his 3 children in the druidic arts. His wife spent most of the day in pursuit of knowledge.

One evening, as they ate dinner, his wife starting whispering something under her breath. Spifanon realized he couldn't move. Inky black tentacles appeared all over the dining area and shot towards his 3 kids. The last he saw of them was their terrified faces as they were wrapped up and dissolved by the tentacles.

His wife's chanting seemed to go silent and a voice boomed in his head. "Interesting, I think I'll take you instead." The tentacle that had been heading towards him, diverted and took his wife instead. He watched in horror as her face melted into a gruesome mockery of her once beautiful smile.

Once he could move, he grabbed her deformed body and ran to the Elder Stag. Upon seeing the corrupted satyr, the Stag turned and fled. Spifanon's connection to the natural world was severed. He sat for weeks in the grove, slowly losing his mind and memories until a voice called to him, offering him power.
