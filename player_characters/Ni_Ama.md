## Background

A Spring Eladrin Druid from the Feywilds, she came over a short while after the Guild sent some members on an extended mission.
Little did they know that after their departure, the Court was abuzz with talk, tales, and fanfiction of the brave group.
Ni Ama, being a consummate explorer and plant cultivator/Wilds protector, used the possibility of exploring a new plane as a fantastic excuse to come through the portal and join the Guild.
Reality being she just wanted to meet all the hero's she had heard so many tales about.

Spring Eladrins are the embodiment of new life, energy, and regrowth.
Flowers tend to bloom, and plants will sprout in her presence when excited or happy.

### Early days in the Guild

Ni Ama spent the first several month at the guild getting all of her guild paraphernalia signed. She was bright, bubbly, and the purest embodiement of spring. 

She went on missions with Reysatra and as one of the few elvish speakers became friends with her.

### Courting Theren
Ni Ama met Theren, the brother of Reysatra, and shortly began to fall for him despite his outwardly cold demeanor. They would share several tender moments along the corridors and on missions such as when Theren road a polymorphed Ni Ama as a horse. 

After several months Ni Ama confesses to Theren being her one and only and they begin officially courting.

### Theren's Death
Ni Ama had been shaken by the recent deaths of her guildmates but Theren's death was the final straw to change her season. During Theren's memorial service, her hair changed from green to blue and the tempurature shifted from from a spring warmth to winter's cold.

Since his death she has become more cold and cunning.
