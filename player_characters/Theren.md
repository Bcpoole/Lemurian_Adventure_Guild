## Description
A Wood elf stands before you, his coffee eyes showing disinterest in all around him even though his face is smiling serenely. Oddly, he does not have any weapons or armor within sight, instead he is wearing brown and dark green vestments, which has a golden Oak tree embroidered on the chest. The green of the vestments compliments his hair and goatee, being a 2 shades lighter in color. His copper skin has no blemishes except for an intricate tattoo on his right hand, which glows when he introduces himself.

## Background

Theren is the first born of his family, being born from loving parents. His love for learning had him originally pursuing a career in research before his Life Cleric powers were revealed at the age of 35. It was a blessing in disguise, since it allowed him to roam the world on different pilgrimages, seeing quite a bit the world has to offer. 

He was ecstatic to welcome his baby sister, and devastated with her death a few years later when the village was attacked by raiders. This lead to him meeting his adopted little sister, Reysatra.
