# History of Lemuria

![history](/img/archives/history.png)

The Kingdom of Lemuria was founded 512 years ago. It covers a majority of the continent.

Prior to the Kingdom, the continent was divided into several small territories governed by local lords. Politicking and skirmishes were common as the lords vied for power and more territory. Adam Aestus was born the second son of one such lord. Knowing he would not inherit his father's lands, he set off on his own journey to see the world. Along the way, he gathered friends and made contacts. He also saw how the people suffered under the constant fighting and instability. Aestus returned home and persuaded his brother, now a Lord, to begin a campaign to unite the fractured lands under a single banner.

At first, Aestus experienced a string of successes both diplomatic and military, forming a burgeoning Kingdom from the nearby territories. The Kingdom continued to grow, but after a few years, Aestus hit a block as his enemies allied against him. His borders were now vast and he lacked the troops to defend them. Aestus sought aid by traveling to the Feywild with a small group of trusted companions. Not much is known about what transpired there, but when he returned, Aestus had fey with him that built a magical portal. This portal allowed him to send small but powerful squadrons anywhere he needed them in the blink of an eye. The portal turned the tide of the war, and in the year 1487 of the Third Age, the last of the enemy alliance broke and swore allegiance to the Kingdom.

Aestus allowed many of the local lords to retain their lands and titles in exchange for swearing fealty to his crown. He maintained the Kingdom army, but even allowed the local lords to keep their own forces if they wished to help fight against local threats. The Kingdom took on the defense of the borders and responsibility for larger threats within the land from monsters and rebellion. Use of the portal was granted to an offshoot branch of the military named the Lemurian Guild. The Guild's rapid response due to the portal helped the Kingdom to flourish and is credited for the relative peace the people have enjoyed since the Great War.
