# The Archives

:::info Minimo's Scribbles
"Stories are forgotten, heros die, notes are buried. Knowledge is only forever if it is accessible." - Minimo

The Lemurian Adventure Guild Archives is a repository of knowledge for Lemurian guildmembers. It contains a mixture of dossiers, notes, folders, and stories volenteers have compiled overtime. 

If a person is lucky, they might find their answers in the Archives.

:::tip
The Archives are the in-game name for the wiki. It is maintained by volenteers.

Check the Archives for in-game history and you might be able to avoid spending time units on research :wink:.
