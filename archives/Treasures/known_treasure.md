## Horn of Naydra

An unassuming horn that can be used to ritually cast a true ressurection. Was last known to be in the possession of Landon Cruise.

:::note Landon Cruise's confession
> "It was during a seemingly mundane visit to the Market of the Arcane, a place where relics of power and objects of obscure origin converge, that I encountered a merchant. This merchant, an individual of no particular renown, possessed an item whose significance was lost on mostâ€”a dusty, unassuming large horn wrapped in beads that could have been mistaken for mere detritus like a ram's horn trumpet by the untrained eye.
> 
> Recognizing the potential where others saw junk, I approached the merchant. With the practiced ease of one who has navigated the treacherous waters of magical trade for decades, I inquired about the horn after perusing some of his other wares. The merchant, unaware of the true value of the item in his possession, spoke of it as a curiosity, an oddity he had acquired in his travels, the origins of which were as murky as its surface was dull.
> 
> With a keen eye and a sharper mind, I discerned the truth of the matter. The Horn of Naydra, an artifact of legend, lay before me, its power veiled by centuries of neglect and the ignorance of its current custodian. With a negotiation that was as much an art form as my most intricate spells, I acquired the Horn for a sum that would make beggars weep.
> 
> Naydra was a being of pure magic, a greatwyrm, embodying the very essence of life and the cosmos. The lore suggests that the Horn is one of Naydra's own, granted to a hero of long ago legend as he fought the tyranny of the Death King, imbued with the dragon's power to breach the veil between life and death, to heal wounds not just of the flesh but of the spirit." 
> 
> "So I began working on devising a method to distil down the magical essence of the horn into a life giving tincture. It's inherit properties able to cast the lost, dead ritual True Resurrection."
