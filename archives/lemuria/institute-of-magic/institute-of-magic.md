# Institute of Magic

Lemuria's premiere magical academy. The Institute of Magic is a cloistered building in a far off corner of the kingdom. They perform all kinds of magical research there from developing new spells to studying artifacts. The gates are pristine white marble and the iron gates were said to be forged and shaped entirely with magic.

The institute has a branch office in the capital.
