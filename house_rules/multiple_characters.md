# Multiple Characters

## Overview 

Players may create multiple characters if they wish. All resources for the characters including items and gold must be kept separate. Loans of gold or items are not allowed between one player's multiple characters either directly or through a 3rd party. Note that creating multiple characters will slow your growth progression over time, but will grant you more flexibility.

The DMs do not recommend creating more than 2 characters as this will drastically slow your character progression. However, if you still wish to create a 3rd character, you may do so. You will be limited to only 2 active characters in the discord on any given week. This includes RP spaces, usage of time units, and interactions with other characters and NPCs.

## New Character Creation

Please roll character stats with Avrae in the discord.
Players can use the the best 6 out of 7 stat rolls. 
Each stat roll is 4d6, drop the worst roll.
The discord is set up to automatically do this with the ```!rollstats``` command. 
See the example below:
