# Extra Bonus Actions

## Change Weapon

You may use a bonus action to safely switch weapons (including put on or stow a shield).
Instead of stowing items, you may drop them in your current square and draw a new one as a free action

## Quick Access Slot

You may move one potion into an easily accessible pouch for fast usage.
You may drink this potion as a bonus action.
Accessing and feeding this potion to another player is still a standard action.
It takes a standard action to find another potion in your bag and move it to the quick access pouch.

Alternatively, you can store a [spell scroll](../Crafting%20Rules/spell_scrolls#casting) in your quick action slot.

## Quick Observation / Quick Recall

You may use a bonus action to perform observation based skills or knowledge based skills.
When using these skills as a bonus action, the DC will be higher than using your action.
