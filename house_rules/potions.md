# Crafting Potions

Characters must spend time learning how to brew potions and pay for materials to experiment with.
Once a potion recipe is learned, they may spend time units to brew that potion.
Brewing a potion requires an Intelligence (Arcana) check and characters must pay for the materials to generate the potion.
Attempting to brew potions has a chance of failure which may result in loss of time and loss of the potion materials.

:::tip
Characters may choose to spend `2 time units` on one brewing attempt, giving them advantage on their Intelligence (Arcana) check.
:::

Inquire with the DM for costs on learning and brewing potions.
