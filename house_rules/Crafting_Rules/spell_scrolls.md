# Spell Scrolls

## Casting

To use a spell scroll, you must have the spell on your class spell list. 
If the spell scroll is of a level higher than you can currently cast, you must make a spellcasting ability check to determine if you succeed with DC = `12 + spell level`. 
On a failure, the spell fizzles and the scroll burns without effect. 
For any scroll successfully cast, the spell save DC is 12 + spell level and the attack bonus is 2 + spell level (regardless of the person who created the scroll or who is casting it). 

If you wish to use a spell scroll with a cast time of `bonus action` or `reaction`, then this spell must be equipped to your [quick access slot](../Combat_Rules/Extra_Bonus_Action_Options#quick-access-slot).

## Crafting

The crafting character must be proficient in **Arcana**. The appropriate spell slot and the gold cost must be supplied at the beginning of the crafting process. Any material components required for the spell must also be supplied at the beginning of crafting.

See table below for the crafting gold costs and time units.

Spell Level | Price | Time Units

2nd | 75 gp | 3
