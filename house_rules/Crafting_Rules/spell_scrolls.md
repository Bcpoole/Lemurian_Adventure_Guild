# Spell Scrolls

**Crafting and Using Spell Scrolls**

## Casting

To use a spell scroll, you must have the spell on your class spell list. If the spell scroll is of a level higher than you can currently cast, you must make a spellcasting ability check to determine if you succeed with DC = `12 + spell level`. On a failure, the spell fizzles and the scroll burns without effect. For any scroll successfully cast, the spell save DC is `12 + spell` level and the attack bonus is `2 + spell level` (regardless of the person who created the scroll or who is casting it).

If you wish to use a spell scroll with a cast time of `bonus action` or `reaction`, then this spell must be equipped to your [quick access slot](../Combat_Rules/Extra_Bonus_Action_Options#quick-access-slot).

## Crafting

The crafting character must be proficient in Caligraphy Tools and Arcana. The appropriate spell slot and the gold cost must be supplied at the beginning of the crafting process and each spell scroll must be completed before a new spell scroll crafting can begin. Any material components required for the spell must also be supplied at the beginning of crafting. Spell scrolls can never contain a spell cast at a higher level than the base spell.

Characters may create magic scrolls during downtime by performing the following actions:

- Pay gp for the magical material supplies; cost depending on the level of the spell, see table below.
- Cast the spell from their prepared spell list and expend the spell slot.
- Provide any material components required to cast the spell (if any).
- Spend time units appropriate for the level of the spell (see table below, ie spend 3 time units for a first level spell, 5 time units for 2nd level, etc). This can be split across multiple rests.

| Spell Level | Price  | TU |
| ----------- | ------ | -- |
| 1st         | 25 gp  | 3  |
| 2nd         | 75 gp  | 5  |
| 3rd         | 225 gp | 10 |
| 4th         | 675 gp | 20 |
| 5th         | 2025 gp | 40 |
