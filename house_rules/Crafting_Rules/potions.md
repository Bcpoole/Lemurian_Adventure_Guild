# Crafting Potions

## Rules

The crafting character must be proficient in `Alchemist’s Tools`. Upon gaining proficiency in Alchemist’s Tools, you know the recipe for Healing Potions. All other potion recipes must be learned.

Characters must spend time learning how to brew potions and pay for materials to experiment with.
Once a potion recipe is learned, they may spend time units to brew that potion.
Brewing a potion requires Alchemist's Tools proficiency and characters must pay for the materials to generate the potion.
Attempting to brew potions has a chance of failure which may result in loss of time and loss of the potion materials.

:::tip
Characters may choose to spend `2 time units` on one brewing attempt, giving them advantage on their Intelligence (Alchemist's Tools) check.
:::

Inquire with the DM for costs on learning and brewing potions.

### Healing Potions

Supplies for crafting healing potions are available for purchase from Kahjit for 25gp per potion (payable after crafting the potion). He has a limited supply that refreshes every "week" (long rest).

You may also forage for healing potion materials in a nearby grove outside the Guild. There are limited materials available each "week" as well.

Foraging requires one time unit of **Survival**. You will find a variable amount of materials depending on your roll. These must be used within the day (rest period) or they will expire and be unusable.

Crafting healing potions require one time unit with an **Intelligence** check plus proficiency (Alchemist's Tools). You can craft a variable number of healing potions depending on your roll.
