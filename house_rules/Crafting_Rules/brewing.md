# Alcohol Brewing

## Brewing Magical Alcohols

The crafting character must be proficient in `Brewer’s Tools`. Special brews are alcoholic drinks with special properties that impact your character’s downtime in the rest periods. Each brew has the following properties: 

**Threshold**: The cumulative total you need to reach to complete one cask of the brew (one roll per time unit). Once completed the cask is sealed and the brew is stable until opened. The brewing process can span multiple rest periods.
**Cost**: The cost of ingredients paid upon starting the brewing process.
**Servings**: How many servings are created in one cask. Once the cask is opened, it must be used immediately. No servings can be saved.
**DC**: Overindulging in alcoholic beverages can have consequences. After gaining the benefits of the drink, make a con save. If one drink was consumed, the DC is the base number. For each serving beyond the first a character consumes, the DC increases by the increment given in parentheses. On a failure, the character is poisoned for the entirety of the short rest period but recovers prior to the Monday missions.
**Benefit**: What the drink does for you.

Upon gaining proficiency in Brewer’s Tools, you know the recipes for Restorative Riesling and Studious Sangria. Additional recipes may be researched and learned. 

## Basic Recipes

All people with Brewing Supplies proficiency can make basic special brews

### Restorative Riesling

- **Threshold**: 50 - Brewer's Supplies
- **Cost**: 50gp
- **Servings**: 5
- **DC**: 5 (+3 per drink)

If you spend a hit die to regain HP on a short rest, you may regain one additional d10 of HP. You may only benefit from additional servings of the Restorative Riesling if you spent additional hit dice.


### Studious Sangria

- **Threshold**: 50 - Brewer's Supplies
- **Cost**: 50gp
- **Servings**: 5
- **DC**: 5 (+3 per drink)

If your next time unit spent is to perform research or learn a new skill, the roll is made at advantage. Additional servings apply to subsequent time unit rolls but must be within the same rest period.
