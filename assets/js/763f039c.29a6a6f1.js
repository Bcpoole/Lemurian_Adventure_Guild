There\u2019s no getting out of the slums.\u201d Gustabo just couldn\u2019t understand. All the hopes and dreams in his father must have withered and died long ago. Desperate to change something, he went to the fixer in the neighborhood. The jobs he took were small at first. Using mage hand to place forged documents in the tax collector\u2019s office through an open window. Tripping a courier so his satchel could be \u201cfiltered\u201d. Gustabo used some of his earnings to bring food home, but he also hid some extra gold under the floor boards of his room. But soon the fixer was assigning him jobs that didn\u2019t feel right.

How would he and his family every get out of the slums if he wasn\u2019t willing to use his power to make real money? He needed to clear his head. He crept out of the shack he called home and walked to the waterfront to collect his thoughts. Working for the fixer wasn\u2019t the right thing to do. He shouldn\u2019t be using his power to perform crimes but to correct them. Gustabo would find another way to make money and help his family.
