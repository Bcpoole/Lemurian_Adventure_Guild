Aestus sought aid by traveling to the Feywild with a small group of trusted companions. Not much is known about what transpired there, but when he returned, Aestus had fey with him that built a magical portal. This portal allowed him to send small but powerful squadrons anywhere he needed them in the blink of an eye. The portal turned the tide of the war, and in the year 1487 of the Third Age, the last of the enemy alliance broke and swore allegiance to the Kingdom."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Aestus allowed many of the local lords to retain their lands and titles in exchange for swearing fealty to his crown.

Use of the portal was granted to an offshoot branch of the military named the Lemurian Guild.
