He found Lance's body washed up on a riverbank barely breathing and then nursed him back to health. There is a period of 5 months he knows nothing about. When he were well enough to travel, he went to the nearest city and got in contact with a Guild representative. They questioned he and he realized he could recall nothing from the gaps in his memory. The Guild rep offered to set him up with an apprenticeship in town. However, he said he wanted to find his father and find out what happened to him. The Guild rep shared that if he really wanted to do that, he should go join the Lemurian Guild.
