My parents were caravan traders who knew how to make the crossing of the Great Desert. One day, a blue dragon attacked the caravan. I ended up pinned underneath one of the wagons, but it meant the dragon never noticed me. I was the only one to survive. After the dragon left, I pulled together whatever I could from the wreckage and waited for another caravan to come through. I bartered my way onto it and ended up in the Hershey Empire with nothing but the torn dress on my back. Things were... bad there. I ended up stealing to survive and found out I was pretty good at it. So when I saw a guy in fancy clothes strutting around, I though I'd try my luck. Turned out it was Alvis. He caught me in a second, of course. I was so scared, I thought for sure I was about to lose a hand. But instead, he asked if I wanted a job. He gave me some simple little tasks to do, but he made them sound so important, and in exchange he gave me all the food I could eat and a new dress. When he was leaving I begged him to take me along, and so I wound up here. I picked up things here and there just watching people train when I had time. When we got a little older, my sisters and I started begging for them to let us take missions. It wasn't until we were 14 they finally let us take some of the low risk ones. So there, 16 years ago if you're asking when I first came here, 8 years since I became an official member.\"")))}A.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
